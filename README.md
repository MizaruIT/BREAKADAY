**[ATTENTION]** The script provided is for educational and informational purposes only, I am not responsible of any actions that you could take with it.

## üìñ About the project <a name="about-the-project"/>
During a penetration test on an Active Directory (AD) infrastructure, it often hapens to find some unpatched workstations, servers, etc. To automate the searching process for these vulnerable versions, the script has been created. The first version was scripted in Bash and is available on:  https://github.com/MizaruIT/BREAKADAY_BASH.

In addition of the searching part, the script was made to find new ways of compromission. For this, the database Neo4j (and BloodHound) is used to create the paths of compromission from the vulnerable computers. In brief, for each computer vulnerable, a new value "isVulnerableToX" is set. It can be used with cypher queries.

## üõ† Installation <a name="installation"/>
**NEW WAY - Via Docker : AIO**

All the explanations of the Docker installation (creation of the image, run, and launch are described into DOCKER/HowToDocker.txt). You just need to replace the term with a "$".

!!! HOWEVER THE SCRIPT "breakaday.py" IS ONLY EXECUTABLE THROUGH THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE FOLDER: SCAN, SCAN_AD & POC.  A CONTRARIO FROM THE BASH VERSION: https://github.com/MizaruIT/BREAKADAY_BASH.

**With detailed explanations**
```sh
## Build the image (from the root folder of the project BREAKADAY_BASH)
docker build -f DOCKER/breakaday.all.dockerfile . -t breakaday_all

## Create the containeur : choose the shared folder from your host, then you can work with it.
docker run -it -v $/$SHARED_FOLDER_FROM_HOST/:/workspace --name $DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME $DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME (here = breakaday_all)

## Once, you want to relaunch it, just find the container with the name specified previously and relaunch it
# To find the list of containers (running or exited)
docker container ls -a
breakaday_all     latest    4c471cffda24   15 hours ago        11.5GB

# Start and execute it (as an example, there the ID would be = 4c471cffda24)
docker start $ID 
docker exec -it $ID zsh
```

**All in one - Create the container (with the name = persistent_breakaday_all) with the shared folder into your current directory**
```sh
docker build -f DOCKER/breakaday.all.dockerfile . -t breakaday_all
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspace --name persistent_breakaday_all breakaday_all

# And then to use the script, you must have POC/SCANNER_AD/SCANNER folders into the same directory than the script 
# Go into the directory created for
cd /opt/tools/my_scripts/BREAKADAY

# Launch it

```

Once you are into the container, you get access to the scripts and the scanners/PoC tools
```sh

### Structure of the project <a name="structure-project"/>
The project has the following structure once it is launched for the first time (the folder known-data is created at the launch execution).

[!] The scanner <b>must be run from the root folder</b> (or the folders SCANNER, SCANNER_AD must be its subfolders) due to the existing symlinks used.

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ POC/	 		# The scripts for PoC of known vulnerabilities
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SCANNER/ 		# The scanners used to check if an IP, DC, etc. is vulnerable to a specific attack
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SCANNER_AD/		# The scanners used to query the Active Directory (via nmap, LDAP, etc.)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ known-data/		# It contains folders filled with data obtained during the reconnaissance and exploitation phases. 
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ accounts/	# Data about the known accounts + domain infos (local accounts, domain accounts, domain controllers IP/name, etc.)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exploits/	# Data about the exploits (such as shellcode, etc.)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ network/	# Data about the network (retrieved during the scanning/reconnaissance phase) such as RPC, SMB, RDG opened ports, etc.
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vulns/		# Data about the vulnerabilities exploited during the "reconnaissance" phase with exploits (CVE, MS, etc.)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ breakaday.py	# The All-In-One tool used to enumerate, scan, and ease the Active Directory compromission
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt			# The python dependencies required to make it works.
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ubuntu_requirements.txt		# The Linux dependencies required to make it works (especially the exploitation part)

### Use example(s) <a name="use-examples"/>
The recommended way to use the script is the following:

**1) Launch it**
```sh
python3 breakaday.py
```

**2) Scan the network by choosing: "Option 1: Scanning the network"**

You will be asked for the range (network/subnet), enter it and then the results are now stored into **known-data/network**.

**3) (Optional) Depending on the information in your possession:**

- Do you have any accounts? 
- Do you have any DCs (IP, hostname) infos not already know?

If yes, select: **"Option 5: Add infos"** and add the account(s) and DCs to the known data (it will be added into **known-data/accounts**).

If no, pass to the **step 4**.

**4) Search for known vulnerabilities (CVE, MS, etc.) by choosing: "Option 2: Searching for vulnerabilities"**

You will be asked to choose the scenario that you want to try (ex: without account, with a domain account, etc. thus it refers to the **step 3**). 

Once you selected it, you will have to choose among the potential vulnerabilities. While there is a vulnerability that you want to try, select it and wait, then the results are now stored into **known-data/vulns**.

**5) Launch your Neo4j database and select "Option 4: Setting and requesting BloodHound"**

It will ask you your neo4j username, password and port used by the database, enter them. Then, to import the data retrieved from the **step 4**, you **must have a valid domain account**. If you don't already added any domain accounts into the file, go back to the **step 3** if you have one, else, you should go to the **step 6** and try to compromise the Active Directory a bit more (at least having a domain account) before doing the **step 5**. 

**6) Try to exploit the potential vulnerabilities**


## üî≠ ROADMAP <a name="roadmap"/>
- [x] Add a function to scan the network (RPC, microsoft DS, RDG ports and domain + domain controllers infos)
- [x] Add a function to search for vulnerable IPs, DCs, etc.
	- [ ] Improve the function to retrieve the DC hostname
	- [ ] Create a .ps1 script for local attacks? (idk)
- [x] Create the same script but in Bash programming langage (url:[URL](https://github.com/MizaruIT/BREAKADAY_BASH)) 
- [x] Add a function to set data in BloodHound
	- [ ] Create shortestPaths from owned (IP vulnerable to attacks) to DA, DCs, etc.
- [x] Add a function for adding, removing infos about the pentest (such as accounts, domain infos, DC infos, etc.)
- [x] Add a function to get information about the different attacks (description, exploit steps, mitigations, links)
- [x] Add a function to exploit vulnerable IP, DCs, etc. depending on the result of the searching function
 	- [ ] Add exploits for local accounts
 	- [ ] Implement others exploits
 	- [ ] Verify that the exploitations for each implemented vulnerabilities are working (especially the shellcode generation + reverse shell)
